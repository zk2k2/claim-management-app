# Claim Manager üöó

Welcome to Claim Manager, an application designed to simplify the management of automobile insurance claims. Built with Angular 16 and Spring Boot 3, Claim Manager offers a comprehensive solution to handle claims efficiently.

## How Claim Manager Works
Claim Manager provides a user-friendly interface to manage automobile insurance claims seamlessly. Here's how it allows you to manage claims effectively:

### 1. Claim Management
- Manage claims efficiently by creating, reading, updating, or deleting them with all relevant details.
  
### 2. Photo Management
- Effortlessly handle accident photos by uploading, viewing, updating, or deleting them directly within claims for documentation and assessment.
  
### 3. Angular 16 and Spring Boot 3 Integration
Claim Manager leverages the latest features and capabilities of Angular and Spring Boot to provide a robust and responsive user experience. Angular powers the frontend, offering dynamic and interactive interfaces, while Spring Boot handles the backend, ensuring efficient data processing and management.
