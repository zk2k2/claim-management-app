# Claim Manager üöó

Welcome to Claim Manager, an application designed to simplify the management of automobile insurance claims. Built with Angular 16 and Spring Boot 3, Claim Manager offers a comprehensive solution to handle claims efficiently.

## How Claim Manager Works
Claim Manager provides a user-friendly interface to manage automobile insurance claims seamlessly. Here's how it allows you to manage claims effectively:

### 1. Claim Management
- **Create**: Easily create new claims by providing relevant details such as policy information, accident description, and involved parties.
- **Read**: Access and view existing claims with all associated information including status, coverage details, and any attached documents.
- **Update**: Modify claim details as necessary, such as updating contact information or adjusting coverage.
- **Delete**: Remove outdated or irrelevant claims from the system when they are no longer needed.

### 2. Photo Management
- **Upload**: Attach photos related to car accidents directly to the claim for better documentation and assessment.
- **View**: Access and view photos associated with each claim to gain a visual understanding of the incident.
- **Update**: Replace or add new photos to claims as necessary for comprehensive documentation.
- **Delete**: Remove unnecessary or redundant photos from claims to keep the data organized.

### 3. Angular 16 and Spring Boot 3 Integration
Claim Manager leverages the latest features and capabilities of Angular and Spring Boot to provide a robust and responsive user experience. Angular powers the frontend, offering dynamic and interactive interfaces, while Spring Boot handles the backend, ensuring efficient data processing and management.
